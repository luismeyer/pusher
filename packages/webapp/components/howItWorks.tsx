                Use the Top Navigation to configure your Flows Name, Interval,
                Fails and Executions. Pick a <b>Name</b> to identify the Flow,
                it will not be visible to other people.
                <br /> The <b>Interval</b> is the time between two executions.
                Currently you can choose between 6 Hours and 12 Hours.
                <br /> <b>Fails</b> display the amount how often the Flow failed
                in the cloud. After 3 Fails it will no longer be executed. Make
                sure to reset this value after you fixed a failing Flow.
                <br /> With <b>Executions</b> you can run your Flow multiple
                Times handling dynamic Data. Inside the Menu you can create
                Executions and build Variables that can then be placed inside
                the Actions.

                After building the Flow you can use the Test Button to send your
                Flow to the Runner Server. The Runner will execute the Flow like
                it would after you submitted it to the cloud. To help you debug
                any Errors a Screenrecording will be created. Use it to iterate
                on your Flow and make it ready for submission.

                Once you are done testing your Flow you can submit it to the
                cloud. Afterwards it will be executed based on the Interval you
                defined previously. Save the Flow ID so you can always come back
                and edit the Flow later. If you are not done building youre Flow
                but dont wanna loose the Progress, you can disable it before
                submission to avoid fails.

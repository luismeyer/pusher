                Use the Top Navigation to configure your Flows Name, Interval,
                Fails and Executions. Pick a <b>Name</b> to identify the Flow,
                it will not be visible to other people.
                <br /> The <b>Interval</b> is the time between two executions of
                the Flow. Currently you can choose between 6 Hours and 12 Hours.
                <br /> <b>Fails</b> displays the amount how oftern the Flow
                failed in the cloud. The Flow will no longer be executed after 3
                Fails. Make sure to reset this value after you fixed a failing
                Flow.
                <br /> With <b>Executions</b> you can run your Flow multiple
                Times with dynamic Data. Inside the Menu you can create
                Executions and build Variables that can then be placed inside
                the Actions.

                After building the Flow you can use the Test Button to send your
                Flow to the Runner Server. The Runner will execute the Flow like

                any Errors a Screenrecording will be created. Use it to iterate

                Once your done testing you Flow you can submit it to the cloud.
                Afterwards it will be executed based on the Interval you defined
                previously. Save you Flow ID so you can always come back and
                edit your Flow. If you are not done building you Flow but dont
                wanna loose the Progress, you can disable it before you
                submission to avoid fails.
